Afterwards, Ters shows Lema great favor whenever they meet, but Lema, wanting not even a toe to get caught in the twisted power struggles of Kiridara's heptadragons over the right of succession, ignores the fact that Ters likes him even after noticing it. However, while teasing and testing Ters as if in jest, he hears a sincere confession and finds himself swayed as if by a whim.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then one day, Lema's situation suddenly changes, putting him in a difficult position to move freely in Kiridara. He decides to use Ters's feelings, offer himself for a night, and demand a deal in return. However, with a composed face that reveals none of his inner thoughts, Ters politely refuses the seduction and sends him back.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The next day, Ters helps Lema without demanding anything in return, and then presents him with a choice between two options, requesting a relationship that begins with a kiss. In the Dragon's Lake, which had been calm without a single breeze, what will be the end of the ripples he has caused...?<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNote: This is a spin-off prequel to the novel <strong>Antidote<\/strong>.",
